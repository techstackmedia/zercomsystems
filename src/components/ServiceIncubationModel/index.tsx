      <h2>Our Service Incubation Model</h2>
      <p className={styles.description}>
        The Service Incubation model is an alternate funding model for startups that allows professionals to offer their services to startups in return for a minute equity (usually between 0.5% to 1.5%) in the startup. As a service incubator, you will see your share grow as much as 1000% in 12-24 months as been first to invest.

        <div className={styles.hypothesisItem}>
          <p>If startups can seed 5-10% in equity to incubators for $20k to $200k funding most times, they will be willing to seed 10% equity for a $25k service investment</p>
